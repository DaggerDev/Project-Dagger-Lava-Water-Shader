# Project-Dagger-Lava-Water-Shader
Based on the tutorial for making water by Minionsart hacked together with some other bits of shader code to make a cool overlapping shader.

I am making this shader free because it was something that I looked for, for quite some time and ended up figuring out how to make it myself. I took code from the Minionsart shader and did some research on how to create the effect that I was looking for.

Effect can be seen here : <img>https://twitter.com/i/status/1527816445731561472</img>

But yeah, I hope anyone who comes across this enjoys it!
