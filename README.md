# Project-Dagger-Lava-Water-Shader
Based on the tutorial for making water by Minionsart hacked together with some other bits of shader code to make a cool overlapping shader.

I am making this shader free because it was something that I looked for, for quite some time and ended up figuring out how to make it myself. I took code from the Minionsart shader and did some research on how to create the effect that I was looking for.

The shader was inspired by a youtube video I saw some time ago which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rCRsOLiO7k)
